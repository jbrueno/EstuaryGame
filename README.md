Our project focuses on the estuary principles 3(estuaries support a diversity of life) and 4(the need for ongoing research and monitoring).  Our game explores these principles using four minigames. One minigame involves tagging both male and female horseshoe crabs. Another requires the player to learn to take water samples and monitor their tempurature and pH. A side-scroller game allows the player to play the role of a diamondback terrapin, attempting to gain food and avoid obstacles in its habitat. Finally, a species-matching game teaches the player to identify several estuary species. 

We are coding this project in Java using JavaFX
